Note: You need an APP_KEY and APP_SECRET in order to use our application. This is because our app is still in development mode. In order to get an APP_KEY and APP_SECRET, sign up for a Developer account on Dropbox.com. Then create an app (it doesn't matter what it's called or what it does - you're not actually going to create an app, unless you want to!). Make sure that when you create your app, that you give it full access to Dropbox folders.

Once you create an app, you will be provided an APP_KEY and APP_SECRET.

1. Open 'cons.py'
2. In line 24, input your APP_KEY.
3. In line 25, input your APP_SECRET.
4. Type "python cons.py" into the terminal.
5. Follow the directions. 

**Note, CONS comes with a text editor (based on Tkinter, a Python GUI programming framework). The text editor can only read non-proprietary files, such .txt or .py files.
